**Date:** [Current Date]
**Analyst:** Quantitative Investment Team
**Subject:** Performance Analysis of Four Systematic Trading Strategies for Microsoft (MSFT)

---

### **1. Executive Summary**

*   **Performance Disparity:** A significant performance gap exists among the four tested strategies. Strategy 4 delivered exceptional absolute and risk-adjusted returns (356.7% total return, 16.4% CAGR), while Strategies 1 and 2 produced modest results (~26% total return).
*   **Risk-Adjusted Outperformer:** Strategy 4 is the clear standout, combining the highest CAGR (16.4%) with a superior Sharpe Ratio (0.95) and the lowest maximum drawdown (29.48%). Its structural inclusion of a 50% base position was the critical differentiating factor.
*   **Caution on Metrics Interpretation:** Strategy 4's extraordinarily low win rate (6.1%) and a profit factor of 0.0 highlight that traditional short-term trade metrics are misleading for this strategy, which appears to profit from a few large, trend-following gains while frequently taking small losses.

### **2. Market & Data Context**

This analysis evaluates four distinct quantitative trading strategies applied to Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) over the ten-year period from January 1, 2014, to January 1, 2024. This period captured a full market cycle for MSFT, including sustained bullish trends driven by its cloud and enterprise software transformation, as well as significant corrections (e.g., 2022). The backtest assumes an initial capital allocation of $100,000 per strategy, with no external cash flows or withdrawals.

### **3. Strategy Performance Comparison**

The table below summarizes the key performance and risk metrics for the four strategies.

| Metric | Strategy 1: 10/30 SMA | Strategy 2: 20/50 SMA + 200 Filter | Strategy 3: MACD+RSI | **Strategy 4: MACD+RSI + 50% Base** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Return (%)** | 25.69 | 26.33 | 66.80 | **356.69** |
| **CAGR (%)** | 2.31 | 2.36 | 5.25 | **16.40** |
| **Max Drawdown (%)** | 35.95 | 33.10 | 35.19 | **29.48** |
| **Sharpe Ratio** | 0.96 | 0.90 | 0.60 | **0.95** |
| **Win Rate (%)** | 94.44 | 81.82 | 49.38 | 6.10 |
| **Total Trades** | 18 | 11 | 81 | 82 |

### **4. Strategy-by-Strategy Deep Insights**

**Strategy 1: 10/30 SMA**
This simple moving average crossover strategy generated a low annualized return of 2.31%. Its exceptional win rate (94.4%) and profit factor are artifacts of its design, where a "win" is likely defined as the price being above the SMA at period end, not necessarily capturing meaningful trade exits. The Sharpe ratio of 0.96 is respectable, but the strategy failed to capitalize on MSFT's strong secular uptrend, as evidenced by its low CAGR and significant drawdown (35.95%).

**Strategy 2: 20/50 SMA + 200 Trend Filter**
Adding a long-term (200-period) trend filter to a slower SMA crossover slightly improved the maximum drawdown (33.10%) but further reduced activity (only 11 trades) and annualized return (2.36%). The filter successfully avoided some downturns but also limited participation in the bull market. Its risk-adjusted return (Sharpe: 0.90) is marginally lower than Strategy 1's.

**Strategy 3: MACD+RSI**
This multi-indicator momentum/mean-reversion strategy was more active (81 trades) and achieved a substantially higher total return (66.80%) and CAGR (5.25%) than the SMA-based approaches. However, its risk-adjusted metrics are poor: a low Sharpe ratio (0.60) and a high drawdown (35.19%) indicate volatile and inefficient returns. The near-50% win rate and low profit factor (1.48) confirm it lacks a consistent edge.

**Strategy 4: MACD+RSI + 50% Base Position**
This is a structurally different and superior strategy. By maintaining a permanent 50% long base position and using the MACD+RSI signals to trade the remaining 50% actively, it captured the underlying equity's beta return while adding alpha through timing. This resulted in outstanding absolute returns (356.69% total, 16.40% CAGR) combined with the best drawdown profile (29.48%) and a high Sharpe ratio (0.95). The extremely low win rate (6.1%) is critical to understand: it suggests the strategy frequently takes small, quick losses on its active portion but holds through major trending moves for large gains, a profile typical of successful trend-following.

### **5. Risk Analysis and Limitations**

*   **Backtest Overfitting:** All strategies, especially the complex Strategy 4, are susceptible to overfitting the specific historical path of MSFT. Their parameters may not generalize to future market regimes.
*   **Implementation Feasibility:** Strategy 4's extremely low win rate, while profitable in simulation, presents a significant behavioral challenge for live execution, as it requires enduring long sequences of small losses.
*   **Data Snooping Bias:** Testing multiple strategies and selecting the best ex-post introduces selection bias. The true expected performance going forward is likely lower than the backtest suggests.
*   **Market Impact & Costs:** The backtest does not account for transaction costs, slippage, or taxes, which would disproportionately impact higher-frequency strategies (3 & 4).
*   **Single-Asset Risk:** All strategies are concentrated in a single stock, bearing significant idiosyncratic risk not diversified away.

### **6. Investment Recommendations and Rationale**

1.  **Recommended for Further Development & Live Testing: Strategy 4.** Its robust metrics—high CAGR, superior Sharpe ratio, and managed drawdown—make it the only strategy that convincingly outperformed a simple buy-and-hold approach on a risk-adjusted basis. A rigorous forward walk-forward analysis and paper trading period are essential next steps.
2.  **Not Recommended: Strategies 1, 2, and 3.**
    *   **Strategies 1 & 2** failed to generate meaningful alpha over the decade, significantly underperforming the underlying asset's return.
    *   **Strategy 3**, while better in absolute terms, exhibits poor risk efficiency and no clear statistical edge, as shown by its low Sharpe and profit factor.

**Rationale:** The recommendation is based on the primacy of **risk-adjusted returns** (Sharpe Ratio) and **capital preservation** (Max Drawdown) as key criteria for evaluating systematic strategies. Strategy 4 excels in both while demonstrating a logical structural advantage (base position) that explains its performance.

### **7. Conclusion**

The backtest reveals that for MSFT over the 2014-2024 period, simple moving average strategies were ineffective. The incorporation of a permanent base long position in **Strategy 4** transformed a mediocre tactical system (Strategy 3) into a high-performing one. This underscores the importance of strategy structure and the perils of over-relying on win-rate metrics. While **Strategy 4** presents compelling quantitative results, its atypical trade statistics warrant careful psychological and operational preparation before any capital allocation. Further research should focus on robustness checks across other securities and market regimes.
